Number of permutations having exactly K inversions
F(n,K) = F(n-1,k) + F(n,k-1) - ((k >= n) ? F(n-1,k-n) : 0)

Number of permutations having exactly K adjacent swaps is summation of F(n,i) for all i = k to i = 0/1 , i -= 2

Josephus problem: J(n,k) = (J(n-1,k) + k-1)%n + 1
                  J(1,K) = 1
