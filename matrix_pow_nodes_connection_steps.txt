There's a useful theorem we must take into account for this problem and is that when powering the adjacency matrix of any graph to the kth power, what we get in the position (i,j) of the result is the number of paths from i to j that have exactly k steps. Of course, the number of cycles that have exactly k steps are the sum of the elements of the diagonal of the matrix (because are the paths that start and end in the same node). This value is known as the trace of the matrix.
